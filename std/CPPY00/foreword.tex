\nsection{Foreword \& Introduction}

The CPlusPython Community (``the Community'') is the group of individuals that governs
the development of the C-dialect for the Python programming language (``CPlusPython'',
or abbreviated ``\textit{CpPy}'').

For the sake of a more formal and structured development process, standards are
required for consistency among implementions. The Community has therefore prepared this
standard, the \textbf{CPPY00} Standard, to set out the rules and guidelines for the
development and usage around the CpPy dialect.

The CpPy dialect intends to provide an alternative way to use Python. As the name
suggests, CpPy is a ``dialect'' of Python -- it does not aim to evolve as an independent
programming language. This is a core principle that is reflected in the preparation of
this Standard, and is the key to understanding the development and usage of CpPy.

At the time of preparation, the latest stable release of the Python language is
\texttt{3.13.1}. For the sake of stability, the Community intends to design CpPy to be
compatible with version \texttt{3.11.x} of Python.

As the introduction of newer versions of Python, more features may be added to the
Standard, either through revisions or new standards.

Alongside the rules set out in this Standard, examples are supplied to demonstrate the
the rules described.
